The analyst explains that while all the cloud hyperscalers are ramping up their capital spending to invest in AI, investors seem less concerned about Amazon’s AI spending compared to Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). He says, “There's a few unique things” with Amazon,” including “Amazon's not solely reliant on chips from Nvidia” as “ they also build and create their own AI chips that are more cost-effective and of more value. So they may not be seeing the same type of capacity constraint issues that Microsoft is seeing at the moment.” Sundaram notes, “The other thing I would point out too is, you know, Amazon has multiple levers to grow margins,” including their e-commerce business, advertising, Amazon Web Services, and other segments.

Is Microsoft Azure next?: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares climb higher after the Google parent company reported third quarter results that beat Wall Street’s expectations on the top and bottom lines adding confidence that the company’s artificial intelligence investments are paying off. Harvest Portfolio Management CIO and Wall Street Beats partner Paul Meeks joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith to break down the results. Meeks tells Yahoo Finance while he was "favorable" on the overall results, he was “disappointed in year-to-year revenue growth in digital ad sales of only 10%,” but “Google Cloud absolutely knocked it out of the park, growing 35% year-to-year.” The portfolio manager says that results from other cloud hyperscalers, namely Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, and Oracle (ORCL) Cloud infrastructure, may show that Google Cloud took market share. Alphabet’s new CFO Anat Ashkenazi emphasized cutting costs as a key priority, especially as the company continues to invest in AI. Meeks says, “You want to have a CFO spending on the right things but not spending foolishly. So that comment that she made was right out of central casting.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

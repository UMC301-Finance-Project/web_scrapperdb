10. [2024-11-01 20:30:22] Apple needs AI hype to drive upgrades but can't disappoint users: Apple's (AAPL) earnings bring Apple Intelligence into focus as the iPhone maker rolls out its artificial intelligence (AI) features, hoping to drive an accelerated device upgrade cycle. Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the balancing act Apple needs to perform in building excitement around Apple Intelligence to drive upgrades while not overpromising and disappointing users. Bajarin talks about the "unpredictability" that Apple Intelligence presents for Apple and investors trying to gauge how the tech could drive an upgrade cycle. "It's been hard to look back on the history of a couple [of] decades of consumer electronics and really see software itself drive a hardware cycle. It's typically been very hardware-driven, and I think that's the hardest comp that many of us are having to make is to really look at how much of a software angle is actually going to drive a hardware cycle when.... that's not really a comp that we've had before." "I think Apple Intelligence is the most mature kind of consumer AI implementation at a system level for customers," he says, but notes that "Apple's now got to go market and tell that message and make it clear to consumers why are they going to want to use these features." The analyst says while Apple is "in a unique position to onboard and help mature experiences with this software," he worries "that people are coming from either too high of expectations or really no expectations at all because it's not really a driver for them to go and want to use these devices."

26. [2024-11-01 16:54:30] Apple's delayed AI launch a 'real risk' to upgrade cycle: Analyst: Apple (AAPL) may have beat fiscal fourth quarter revenue estimates with $94.9 billion (estimates were for $94.3 billion), but adjusted earnings fell far below Wall Street's expectations due to a one-time charge from a European General Court decision. While Apple's Greater China sales also fell below estimates, the tech giant blew past iPhone sales estimates, posting $46.22 billion against estimates of $45.04 billion. To speak more about Apple's latest earnings print and its position in the Magnificent Seven, Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Seana Smith on Catalysts. "It looks to be a very slow developing supercycle for AI inspired upgrades for the iPhone. And the reason I say that is they had 5.5% growth in iPhone revenue in the September quarter, and they're guiding to total company revenue growth of low single-digit," Forte says. "So I think the two noisy points in the data are that China macroeconomic weakness — China's about 15% of revenue — I think that's making it hard to determine if we're seeing a supercycle and the other is that there was a mismatch in the timing" of the iPhone 16 launch and the later Apple Intelligence software update. Forte denotes the delay in the release of Apple's AI features for the new iPhone model could be a "real risk" to Apple's consumer upgrade cycle. Forte also weighs in on Apple's guidance and why he's still seeing Amazon (AMZN) as a top Big Tech pick.

111. [2024-10-30 21:12:00] Mag 7 earnings underline the group's huge market influence: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) delivered an earnings beat, sending the stock higher and fueling confidence in the “Magnificent Seven” group. With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. “These companies have gotten so large that on earnings events…you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,” Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn’t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, “The reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,” but “We haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale. They're going to focus on CapEx and projections for CapEx.” For more on how Dery navigates investing in the Magnificent Seven, watch the video above.

124. [2024-10-30 16:05:09] Why investors should buy the Mag 7 'right now': Attention is turning to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) as the next members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies set to report their third quarter earnings. To discuss the outlook for these industry leaders, Howard Capital Management CEO and chief investment officer Vance Howard joins Wealth! Howard believes investors should be adding to all of the "Magnificent Seven" names, calling them "the most interesting part of the market," even including Tesla (TSLA), despite its recent stumbles. "Everybody worries about these 'Magnificent Seven', but they are leading this market higher and creating some of the most interesting and dynamic products and services," Howard states. He adds that these tech giants are "making money hand over fist." Regarding the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on these names, Howard drew an analogy to golf, saying that if we were on an 18-hole course, AI would still be "on the very first hole."

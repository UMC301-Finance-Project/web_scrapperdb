So they may not be seeing the same type of capacity constraint issues that Microsoft is seeing at the moment.” Sundaram notes, “The other thing I would point out too is, you know, Amazon has multiple levers to grow margins,” including their e-commerce business, advertising, Amazon Web Services, and other segments.

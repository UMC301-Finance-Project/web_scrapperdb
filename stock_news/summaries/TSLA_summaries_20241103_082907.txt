26. [2024-10-31 14:34:31] Uber is transitioning into a 'software company': Investor: Uber (UBER) reported third quarter results, beating Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings. The rideshare platform posted revenue of $11.19 billion, surpassing estimates of $10.99 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.20, significantly higher than the anticipated $0.45. Despite these positive metrics, Uber's stock faced pressure due to weaker-than-expected gross bookings and a reduced fourth quarter outlook. Kindred Ventures Founder and managing partner Steve Jang joins Morning Brief to provide insights into Uber's performance and future potential. "The company is starting to show that it's not just a marketplace company but a software company," Jang says, highlighting Uber's profitability and continued growth opportunities. Jang emphasizes Uber's strategic positioning, pointing to potential expansion in autonomous and electric vehicles. He praises the company's cost-consciousness and ability to apply its software network across ridesharing, delivery, and freight services. "Uber is the demand network," Jang states, arguing that emerging technologies like Waymo and Tesla's (TSLA) autonomous vehicles will take time to impact the market. However, Uber's global network, software, and 24/7 operations provide a competitive advantage that these companies may want to use in the future.

41. [2024-10-30 21:12:00] Mag 7 earnings underline the group's huge market influence: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) delivered an earnings beat, sending the stock higher and fueling confidence in the “Magnificent Seven” group. With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. “These companies have gotten so large that on earnings events…you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,” Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn’t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, “The reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,” but “We haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale. They're going to focus on CapEx and projections for CapEx.” For more on how Dery navigates investing in the Magnificent Seven, watch the video above.

To discuss the outlook for these industry leaders, Howard Capital Management CEO and chief investment officer Vance Howard joins Wealth! Howard believes investors should be adding to all of the "Magnificent Seven" names, calling them "the most interesting part of the market," even including Tesla (TSLA), despite its recent stumbles. "Everybody worries about these 'Magnificent Seven', but they are leading this market higher and creating some of the most interesting and dynamic products and services," Howard states. He adds that these tech giants are "making money hand over fist." Regarding the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on these names, Howard drew an analogy to golf, saying that if we were on an 18-hole course, AI would still be "on the very first hole." While acknowledging there is still substantial work to be done in the AI space, Howard remains "incredibly bullish" on its long-term potential.

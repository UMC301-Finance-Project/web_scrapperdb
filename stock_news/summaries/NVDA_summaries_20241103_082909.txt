[2024-10-30 21:12:00] Mag 7 earnings underline the group's huge market influence: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) delivered an earnings beat, sending the stock higher and fueling confidence in the “Magnificent Seven” group. With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. “These companies have gotten so large that on earnings events…you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,” Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn’t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, “The reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,” but “We haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale. They're going to focus on CapEx and projections for CapEx.” For more on how Dery navigates investing in the Magnificent Seven, watch the video above.

100. [2024-10-30 16:05:09] Why investors should buy the Mag 7 'right now': Attention is turning to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) as the next members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies set to report their third quarter earnings. To discuss the outlook for these industry leaders, Howard Capital Management CEO and chief investment officer Vance Howard joins Wealth! Howard believes investors should be adding to all of the "Magnificent Seven" names, calling them "the most interesting part of the market," even including Tesla (TSLA), despite its recent stumbles. "Everybody worries about these 'Magnificent Seven', but they are leading this market higher and creating some of the most interesting and dynamic products and services," Howard states. He adds that these tech giants are "making money hand over fist." Regarding the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on these names, Howard drew an analogy to golf, saying that if we were on an 18-hole course, AI would still be "on the very first hole." While acknowledging there is still substantial work to be done in the AI space, Howard remains "incredibly bullish" on its long-term potential.

102. [2024-10-30 15:30:14] Ditch AMD and 'just go with the pure play' Nvidia: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fall after the chipmaker reported third quarter results, with its fourth quarter outlook failing to impress investors. The AMD sell-off fueled a pullback in Nvidia stock as the weaker-than-anticipated guidance fuels some concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) chip demand. Harvest Portfolio Management CIO and Wall Street Beats partner Paul Meeks tells Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith to break down the results and what it means for the company and the AI space. Meeks says, “I have a third of my portfolio in Nvidia. It's been a rock star. I don't think what AMD said yesterday is going to put Nvidia in peril, and with the big move that Nvidia has already seen [and] the fact that it's only down 1% today on AMD's sins, I actually think is a pretty good sign.” He adds, “The problem [with AMD] is not an AI accelerator chip pure play. It's got a CPU business, too, and that business right now kind of sucks. And so the way I look at it, even though AMD will be a viable number two to Nvidia in the AI chip market, and even though the stock trades at a discount to Nvidia, I just go with the pure play. I just buy more Nvidia on this news and continue to avoid AMD, which has been a good trade for me.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

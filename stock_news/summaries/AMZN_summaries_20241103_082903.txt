Citizens JMP Equity Research Analyst Nick Jones breaks down the significance of Amazon's massive tech spending on Morning Brief. Jones emphasizes that Amazon's AI investments are critical to maintaining its competitive edge. "AI is this massive, massive opportunity. We're only a year or so into the opportunity, so we're probably looking at a very long runway of spend," he tells Yahoo Finance. The company plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, and in 2025 "they'll likely spend more." Despite these substantial investments, Jones notes Amazon maintains strong operating income margins, which he sees as a key stock performance indicator. "Amazon's a dominant cloud player. They're going to want to be dominant in AI. They need to keep spending," Jones adds, highlighting what he sees as a "multi-decade runway" for the company's artificial intelligence strategy.

The analyst explains that while all the cloud hyperscalers are ramping up their capital spending to invest in AI, investors seem less concerned about Amazon’s AI spending compared to Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). He says, “There's a few unique things” with Amazon,” including “Amazon's not solely reliant on chips from Nvidia” as “ they also build and create their own AI chips that are more cost-effective and of more value.

88. [2024-10-31 20:21:21] Will the Big Tech sell-off continue? This strategist says yes.: US stocks (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are trading lower, with Big Tech leading the pullback after Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings fed into concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) spending. US SPDR Business at State Street Global Advisors chief investment strategist Michael Arone joins Market Domination Hosts Alexandra Canal and Josh Lipton to discuss his outlook for the Big Tech sector. “What's been happening is that these companies continue to beat on top and bottom line, yet their forecasts just aren't good enough given how far they've come from a price-performance perspective and where their valuations are,” Arone tells Yahoo Finance. The strategist adds, “I do expect this [Big Tech pullback] to continue to unfold, given some of the risks."
